# Write a program to use string.format() method to format the following three variables as per the expected output

# Given:
totalMoney = 1000
quantity = 3
price = 450

# Expected Output:
# I have 1000 dollars so I can buy 3 football for 450.00 dollars.

print(f"I have {totalMoney} dollars so I can buy {quantity} football for {price} dollars.")



# quantity = 3
# totalMoney = 1000
# price = 450
# statement1 = "I have {1} dollars so I can buy {0} football for {2:.2f} dollars."
# print(statement1.format(quantity, totalMoney, price))
