# Difference between error and Exceptions

# Errors are something which are difficult to recover.
# Errors are more severe issues that typically.
# Prevent the program from running.
# impossible -> Syntax, Indentation


# Exceptions (error) -> can be handled.
# Exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program that disrupt the normal flow of instructions
# Program recover can be possible
